          In this Retail Installment Sale Agreement (“Agreement”), the words,
          “you” and “your” mean the Buyer and Co-signer, individually and
          collectively, who sign this Agreement. The words “School,” “we” and
          “us” mean the School named at the top of this Agreement. This
          Agreement incorporates by reference the Private Education Loan Final
          Disclosure Statement (the “Final Disclosure Statement”) that
          accompanies this Agreement.
        </div>

        <h4>A.&ensp;&ensp;GENERAL TERMS</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You agree to purchase from the School, on a time basis, subject to
          the terms of this Agreement, educational services (“Services”)
          offered by the School. You have been given the opportunity to
          purchase the Services for cash or to finance them pursuant to this
          Agreement. You have agreed to finance the purchase of the Services
          over time. We have applied the total amount of funds from sources
          such as federal student loans, other financial aid or personal
          resources toward the cost of the Services as a down payment. You are
          financing the net cost of the Services owed as of the date of this
          Agreement, to the extent that the total cost of the Services is not
          covered by other financial aid resources. You acknowledge that this
          extension of credit is a qualified educational loan and is subject
          to the limitations on dischargeability in bankruptcy contained in
          Section 523(a)(8) of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
        </div>
        <br />

        <div class="paragraph">
          The Total of Payments shown on the Final Disclosure Statement is the
          total price of the Services if you pay for them over time so it
          includes finance charges. The Total of Payments shown in the Final
          Disclosure Statement assumes that all payments will be made as
          scheduled. The actual amount you will pay may be more or less
          depending on your payment record.
        </div>
        <br />

        <div class="paragraph">
          You acknowledge and agree that you may purchase additional Services
          from the School at a later date. Any such additional purchases of
          Services will not be added to the balance due under this Agreement
          and instead will be due and payable, or financed in a separate
          agreement, when you purchase them. You also acknowledge and agree
          that we may receive additional financial aid funds for you after the
          date of this Agreement and that we may apply those funds to the
          balance due under this Agreement as a partial prepayment of your
          outstanding balance. If we receive any such additional financial aid
          funds, we will give you notice of that fact and whether the
          prepayment will excuse you from making payments due for a particular
          amount of time, will allow you to make smaller payments or will
          result in a shorter term of this Agreement.
        </div>

        <h4 class="pagebreak">B.&ensp;&ensp;PROMISE TO PAY</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You promise to pay the School, in accordance with the terms of this
          Agreement and the payment schedule included in the Final Disclosure
          Statement the Total Loan Amount shown on the Final Disclosure
          Statement plus finance charges accruing on a daily simple interest
          basis on the unpaid balance at the rate of: ____% per year from
          today’s date until this Agreement is paid in full, and any other
          charges or fees you owe according to the terms and conditions of
          this Agreement. Buyer and any Co-signer who sign this Agreement
          agree to be jointly and individually liable to us for payment of all
          amounts due under the Agreement, regardless of who receives the
          Services.
        </div>

        <h4>C.&ensp;&ensp;LATE FEE; DISHONORED CHECK FEES</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          If you do not make a scheduled payment in full by its due date, you
          agree to pay the late fee shown in the Final Disclosure Statement.
          If any payment that you make on this Agreement is returned for any
          reason, you agree to pay the dishonored check fee shown in the Final
          Disclosure Statement.
        </div>

        <h4>D.&ensp;&ensp;PAYMENT METHODS</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You may make the payments due on this Agreement via check, money
          order, automated clearing house (ACH) debit from a checking or
          savings account, or major debit cards, subject to a non-refundable

        <div class="paragraph">
          Except as provided below, we may declare this Agreement to be in
          default if: (1) you do not make the full amount of any payment by
          its scheduled due date; or (2) any event occurs that, in our
          reasonable judgment, significantly impairs the prospect of your
          payment or performance of this Agreement.
        </div>

        <h4>G.&ensp;&ensp;REMEDIES</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          If you are in default on this Agreement we may require you to
          immediately pay us, subject to any refund or notice requirement
          provided by applicable law, the remaining unpaid balance of the
          Total Loan Amount, finance charges and all other charges as provided
          for in this Agreement. If you live in Illinois, we will require you
          to pay the outstanding unpaid balance no sooner than 30 days after
          you are in default. If you default, we may refer your Agreement for
          collection by a third-party collection agency, initiate actions to
          collect all amounts owed, and/or exercise any other remedies
          available under law and this Agreement. Buyer and any Co-signer who
          sign this Agreement understand and agree that our rights and
          remedies under the Agreement are cumulative. Each of you agrees that
          we may pursue our rights and remedies against any of you
          individually, or against both of you collectively, in any order or
          combination we choose, except to the extent prohibited by law.
        </div>

        <h4 class="pagebreak">H.&ensp;&ensp;COLLECTION FEES</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          If this Agreement is in default and referred to a collection agency
          or an outside attorney to collect the outstanding debt, you will pay
          the costs of collection, including reasonable attorney fees, to the
          extent permitted by applicable law.
        </div>

        <h4>K.&ensp;&ensp;APPLICABLE LAW</h4>

          any manner permissible by law that does not require your prior
          consent.
        </div>

        <h4 class="pagebreak">N. &ensp;&ensp;OBLIGATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BUYER</h4>

          Disclosure Statement. You acknowledge that under the terms of this Agreement, the Services provided
          to the Buyer are provided as an ongoing and continuing service. You agree that the Buyer’s enrollment

        </div>

        <h4>P.&ensp;&ensp;ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          This Agreement is not effective until accepted by the School. The
          Buyer and the Co-signer agree to notify the School of any change in
          their name or address, or the Buyer’s School enrollment status,
          within ten (10) days of such occurrence. You represent that you have
          not made any false written statement with respect to this Agreement.
          We do not intend to charge or collect, and you do not agree to pay,
          any finance charge that is more than the maximum amount permitted
          for this sale by applicable law. If you pay a finance charge or fee
          that is more than allowed by applicable law, we will apply it first
          to reduce the principal balance and, when the principal has been
          paid in full, refund it to you. You also authorize us to contact the
          person identified by the Buyer as having authority to act on behalf
          of the Buyer in the event of the Buyer’s death. You understand and
          agree that, for purposes of evaluating, reviewing, servicing, or
          collecting this Agreement, we may: (1) obtain and use credit
          information and other information about you provided by third
          parties and consumer reporting agencies; and (2) provide information
          about you and the status of this Agreement to third parties and
          consumer reporting agencies. We will, upon request, inform you
          whether we obtained a consumer report about you and, if we did,
          inform you of the name and address of the reporting agency that
          provided the consumer report.
        </div>

        <h4>Q.&ensp;&ensp;CO-SIGNER RELEASE</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, in the event that
          the Buyer dies before the balance due under this Agreement is paid
          in full, we will cancel the remaining balance due under this
          Agreement. In that event, Co-signer will be released from all
          liability to us under this Agreement. We will notify the Co-signer
          within a reasonable timeframe if this provision of theis Agreement
          applies.
        </div>

        <h4>R.&ensp;&ensp;SEVERABILITY</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or is prohibited by law, such
          provision shall be considered ineffective without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
          Agreement.
