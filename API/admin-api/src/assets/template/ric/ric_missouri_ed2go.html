          In this Retail Installment Sale Agreement (“Agreement”), the words, “you” and “your” mean the Buyer
          and Co-signer, individually and collectively, who sign this Agreement. The words “Seller,” “we” and “us”
          mean the Seller named at the top of this Agreement. This Agreement incorporates by reference the
          Private Education Loan Final Disclosure Statement (the “Final Disclosure Statement”) that accompanies
          this Agreement.
        </div>

        <h4>A.&ensp;&ensp;GENERAL TERMS</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You agree to purchase from the Seller, on a time basis, subject to the terms of this Agreement, educational
          services (“Services”) offered by the Seller. You have been given the opportunity to purchase the Services
          for cash or to finance them pursuant to this Agreement. You have agreed to finance the purchase of the
          Services over time.
        </div>
        <br />

        <div class="paragraph">
          The Total of Payments shown on the Final Disclosure Statement is the total price of the Services if you pay
          for them over time so it includes finance charges. The Total of Payments shown in the Final Disclosure
          Statement assumes that all payments will be made as scheduled. The actual amount you will pay may be
          more or less depending on your payment record.
        </div>
        <br />

        <div class="paragraph">
          You acknowledge and agree that you may purchase additional Services from the Seller at a later date. Any
          such additional purchases of Services will not be added to the balance due under this Agreement and
          instead will be due and payable, or financed in a separate agreement, when you purchase them.
        </div>

        <h4>B.&ensp;&ensp;PROMISE TO PAY</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You promise to pay the Seller, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the payment schedule
          included in the Final Disclosure Statement the Total Loan Amount shown on the Final Disclosure
          Statement plus finance charges accruing on a daily simple interest basis on the unpaid balance at the
          Interest Rate shown on the Final Disclosure Statement from today’s date until this Agreement is paid in
          full, and any other charges or fees you owe according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
          Buyer and any Co-signer who sign this Agreement agree to be jointly and individually liable to us for
          payment of all amounts due under the Agreement, regardless of who receives the Services.
        </div>
        <h4 class="pagebreak">C.&ensp;&ensp;LATE FEE; DISHONORED CHECK FEES</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          If you do not make a scheduled payment in full by its due date, you agree to pay the late fee shown in the
          Final Disclosure Statement. If any payment that you make on this Agreement is returned for any reason,
          you agree to pay the dishonored check fee shown in the Final Disclosure Statement.
        </div>

        <h4>D.&ensp;&ensp;PAYMENT METHODS</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">

        <h4>F.&ensp;&ensp;DEFAULT</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Except as provided below, we may declare this Agreement to be in default if: (1) you do not make the full
          amount of any payment by its scheduled due date; or (2) any event occurs that, in our reasonable
          judgment, significantly impairs the prospect of your payment or performance of this Agreement.
        </div>

        <h4>G.&ensp;&ensp;REMEDIES</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          If you are in default on this Agreement we may require you to immediately pay us, subject to any refund
          or notice requirement provided by applicable law, the remaining unpaid balance of the Total Loan
          Amount, finance charges and all other charges as provided for in this Agreement. If you default, we may
          refer your Agreement for collection by a third-party collection agency, initiate actions to collect all
          amounts owed, and/or exercise any other remedies available under law and this Agreement. Buyer and
          any Co-signer who sign this Agreement understand and agree that our rights and remedies under the
          Agreement are cumulative. Each of you agrees that we may pursue our rights and remedies against any
          of you individually, or against both of you collectively, in any order or combination we choose, except to
          the extent prohibited by law.
        </div>

        <h4>H.&ensp;&ensp;COLLECTION FEES</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">

          permitted by applicable law.
        </div>

        <h4>I.&ensp;&ensp;WAIVER</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          The Seller will not lose any rights under this Agreement if it delays taking action for any reason. Any change
          to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the Seller.
        </div>

        <h4 class="pagebreak">J.&ensp;&ensp;ASSIGNMENT</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You may not assign this Agreement or any of its benefits and obligations. The Seller may assign this
          Agreement at any time.
        </div>

        <h4>K.&ensp;&ensp;APPLICABLE LAW</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">

        <h4>L.&ensp;&ensp;CREDIT REPORTING</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          The Seller may report information about this Agreement to consumer credit bureaus. Late payments,
          missed payments or other defaults on your Agreement may be reflected on your credit report. You have
          the right to dispute the accuracy and completeness of any information reported about this Agreement to
          a consumer reporting agency. You may do this by giving us notice at our address shown on the front of
          this Agreement, and also by notifying the consumer reporting agency, as provided by law.
        </div>

        <h4>M. &ensp;&ensp;OBLIGATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BUYER</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You agree to make all scheduled payments, in the amounts and by the due dates shown in the Final
          Disclosure Statement. You acknowledge that under the terms of this Agreement, the Services provided to
          the Buyer are provided as an ongoing and continuing service. You agree that the Buyer’s access to courses
          through the Seller is contingent upon this Agreement being paid according to its terms and that, in
          addition to the above remedies for default, if you fail to make any scheduled payment, to the extent
          permitted by law, the Seller may deny access to your course, withhold your certificate, or any other Seller
          service.
        </div>

        <h4>N.&ensp;&ensp;MODIFICATIONS</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          This Agreement contains all of the terms of your agreement with us related to the subject matter of this
          Agreement. Any change to this Agreement must be in writing and we must sign it. No oral changes are
          binding. <B>Oral agreements or commitments to loan money, extend credit or to forbear from enforcing
            repayment of a debt including promises to extend or renew such debt are not enforceable. To protect
            you (buyer) and us (seller) from misunderstanding or disappointment, any agreements we reach
            covering such matters are contained in this writing, which is the complete and exclusive statement of
            the agreement between us, except as we may later agree in writing to modify it.</B>
        </div>

        <h4>O.&ensp;&ensp;ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          This Agreement is not effective until accepted by the Seller. The Buyer and the Co-signer agree to notify
          the Seller of any change in their name or address, or the Buyer’s Seller enrollment status, within ten (10)
          days of such occurrence. You represent that you have not made any false written statement with respect
          to this Agreement. We do not intend to charge or collect, and you do not agree to pay, any finance charge
          that is more than the maximum amount permitted for this sale by applicable law. If you pay a finance charge or
          fee that is more than allowed by applicable law, we will apply it first to reduce the principal
          balance and, when the principal has been paid in full, refund it to you. You understand and agree that, for
          purposes of evaluating, reviewing, servicing, or collecting this Agreement, we may: (1) obtain and use
          credit information and other information about you provided by third parties and consumer reporting
          agencies; and (2) provide information about you and the status of this Agreement to third parties and
          consumer reporting agencies. We will, upon request, inform you whether we obtained a consumer report
          about you and, if we did, inform you of the name and address of the reporting agency that provided the
          consumer report. You also authorize us to contact the person identified by the Buyer as having authority
          to act on behalf of the Buyer in the event of the Buyer’s death.
        </div>

        <h4>P.&ensp;&ensp;SEVERABILITY</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or is prohibited by law, such
          provision shall be considered ineffective without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
        </div>

        <h4>Q.&ensp;&ensp;CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FINAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND THIS AGREEMENT</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You understand and agree that if the information in your Final Disclosure Statement conflicts with the
          information in this Agreement, the information in your Final Disclosure Statement shall control
        </div>

        <h4>
          R.&ensp;&ensp;COMMUNICATION CONSENT
        </h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You agree that we may monitor and record telephone calls regarding your account to assure the quality
          of our service or for other reasons. You agree that we may call you, using an automatic telephone dialing
          system or otherwise, leave you a voice, prerecorded, or artificial voice message, or send you a text, email,
          or other electronic message for any purpose related to the servicing and collection of your account with
          us (each a "Communication"). You agree that we may send a Communication to any telephone numbers,
          including cellular telephone numbers, or e-mail addresses you provided to us in connection with the
          origination of this Agreement or at any time in the future. You acknowledge and confirm that you have
          the authority to provide the consent because you are either the subscriber of the telephone number(s) or
          you are the non-subscriber customary user who has authority to provide the consent. You also agree that
          we may include your personal information in a Communication. You agree that we will not charge you
          for a Communication, but your service provider may. In addition, you understand and agree that we may
          always communicate with you in in any manner permissible by law that does not require your prior
          consent.</div>

        <h4>
          S.&ensp;&ensp;CO-SIGNER RELEASE
        </h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, in the event that the Buyer dies before the balance
          due under this Agreement is paid in full, we will cancel the remaining balance due under this Agreement.
          In that event, Co-signer will be released from all liability to us under this Agreement. We will notify the
          Co-signer within a reasonable timeframe if this provision of this Agreement applies.
