        <div class="paragraph">
          You agree to purchase from the Seller, on a time basis, subject to the terms of this Agreement, educational

          The Total of Payments shown on the Final Disclosure Statement is the total price of the Services if you pay
          for them over time so it includes finance charges. The Total of Payments shown in the Final Disclosure
          Statement assumes that all payments will be made as scheduled. The actual amount you will pay may be
          more or less depending on your payment record.
        </div>
        <br />

        <div class="paragraph">
          You acknowledge and agree that you may purchase additional Services from the Seller at a later date. Any
          such additional purchases of Services will not be added to the balance due under this Agreement and
          instead will be due and payable, or financed in a separate agreement, when you purchase them.
        </div>

        <h4>B.&ensp;&ensp;PROMISE TO PAY</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">

          included in the Final Disclosure Statement the Total Loan Amount shown on the Final Disclosure
          Statement plus finance charges accruing on a daily simple interest basis on the unpaid balance at the
          Interest Rate shown on the Final Disclosure Statement from today’s date until this Agreement is paid in
          full, and any other charges or fees you owe according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
          Buyer and any Co-signer who sign this Agreement agree to be jointly and individually liable to us for
          payment of all amounts due under the Agreement, regardless of who receives the Services.

        <div class="paragraph">
          Except as provided below, we may declare this Agreement to be in default if you have outstanding an
          amount exceeding one full payment for more than 10 days after the scheduled or deferred due dates, or
          you fail to pay the first payment or the last payment within 40 days of its scheduled or deferred due date.
        </div>

        <h4>G.&ensp;&ensp;REMEDIES</h4>

          Loan Amount, finance charges and all other charges as provided for in this Agreement. If you default, we
          may refer your Agreement for collection by a third-party collection agency, initiate actions to collect all
          amounts owed, and/or exercise any other remedies available under law and this Agreement. Buyer and
          any Co-signer who sign this Agreement understand and agree that our rights and remedies under the
          Agreement are cumulative. Each of you agrees that we may pursue our rights and remedies against any
          of you individually, or against both of you collectively, in any order or combination we choose, except to

          permitted by applicable law.</div>

        <h4>I.&ensp;&ensp;WAIVER</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">

          Disclosure Statement. You acknowledge that under the terms of this Agreement, the Services provided to
          the Buyer are provided as an ongoing and continuing service. You agree that the Buyer’s access to courses
          through the Seller is contingent upon this Agreement being paid according to its terms and that, in
          addition to the above remedies for default, if you fail to make any scheduled payment, to the extent
          permitted by law, the Seller may deny access to your course, withhold your certificate, or any other Seller

        </div>

        <h4>O.&ensp;&ensp;ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          This Agreement is not effective until accepted by the Seller. The Buyer and the Co-signer agree to notify
          the Seller of any change in their name or address, or the Buyer’s Seller enrollment status, within ten (10)
          days of such occurrence. You represent that you have not made any false written statement with respect
          to this Agreement. We do not intend to charge or collect, and you do not agree to pay, any finance charge
          that is more than the maximum amount permitted for this sale by applicable law. If you pay a finance
          charge or fee that is more than allowed by applicable law, we will apply it first to reduce the principal
          balance and, when the principal has been paid in full, refund it to you. You understand and agree that, for
          purposes of evaluating, reviewing, servicing, or collecting this Agreement, we may: (1) obtain and use
          credit information and other information about you provided by third parties and consumer reporting agencies;
          and (2) provide information about you and the status of this Agreement to third parties and
          consumer reporting agencies. We will, upon request, inform you whether we obtained a consumer report
          about you and, if we did, inform you of the name and address of the reporting agency that provided the
          consumer report. You also authorize us to contact the person identified by the Buyer as having authority
          to act on behalf of the Buyer in the event of the Buyer’s death.
        </div>

        <h4>P.&ensp;&ensp;SEVERABILITY</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or is prohibited by law, such
          provision shall be considered ineffective without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
        </div>

        <h4>Q.&ensp;&ensp;CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FINAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND THIS AGREEMENT</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You understand and agree that if the information in your Final Disclosure Statement conflicts with the
          information in this Agreement, the information in your Final Disclosure Statement shall control.
        </div>

        <h4>
          R.&ensp;&ensp;COMMUNICATION CONSENT
        </h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          You agree that we may monitor and record telephone calls regarding your account to assure the quality
          of our service or for other reasons. You agree that we may call you, using an automatic telephone dialing
          system or otherwise, leave you a voice, prerecorded, or artificial voice message, or send you a text, email,
          or other electronic message for any purpose related to the servicing and collection of your account with
          us (each a "Communication"). You agree that we may send a Communication to any telephone numbers,
          including cellular telephone numbers, or e-mail addresses you provided to us in connection with the
          origination of this Agreement or at any time in the future. You acknowledge and confirm that you have
          the authority to provide the consent because you are either the subscriber of the telephone number(s) or
          you are the non-subscriber customary user who has authority to provide the consent. You also agree that
          we may include your personal information in a Communication. You agree that we will not charge you
          for a Communication, but your service provider may. In addition, you understand and agree that we may
          always communicate with you in in any manner permissible by law that does not require your prior
          consent.</div>

        <h4>
          S.&ensp;&ensp;CO-SIGNER RELEASE
        </h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, in the event that the Buyer dies before the balance
          due under this Agreement is paid in full, we will cancel the remaining balance due under this Agreement.
