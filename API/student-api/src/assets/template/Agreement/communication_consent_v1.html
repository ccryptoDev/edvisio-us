        Communication Consent
    </h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree that we may monitor and record telephone calls regarding your account
        to assure the quality of our service or for other reasons. You agree that we may call you,
        using an automatic telephone dialing system or otherwise, leave you a voice,
        prerecorded, or artificial voice message, or send you a text, e-mail, or other electronic
        message for any purpose related to the servicing and collection of your account with us
        (each a "Communication"). You agree that we may send a Communication to any
        telephone numbers, including cellular telephone numbers, or e-mail addresses you
        provided to us in connection with the origination of this Agreement or at any time in the
        future. You acknowledge and confirm that you have the authority to provide the consent
        because you are either the subscriber of the telephone number(s) or you are the nonsubscriber
        customary user who has authority to provide the consent. You also agree that
        we may include your personal information in a Communication. You agree that we will not
        charge you for a Communication, but your service provider may. In addition, you
        understand and agree that we may always communicate with you in any manner
        permissible by law that does not require your prior consent. </p><br>
    <p><strong>I agree to receive electronic communications including voice messages, text messages, email and other
            electronic messages.</strong></p>
