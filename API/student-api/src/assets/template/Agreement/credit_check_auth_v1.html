        Credit Check Authorization
    </h1>
    <p>By checking the "Continue" button below, I authorize ELS, a National Lending
        Associates, Inc. company, on behalf of the School or its designated agents,
        and any assignee or guarantor of this contract, to investigate my credit
        worthiness, to access, review and/or share with the School or its designated
        agents, or any assignee or guarantor of this retail installment contract, my
        credit report, and to furnish information about this application and my contract
        to consumer reporting agencies and other persons who may legally receive
        such information. A consumer report may be requested in connection with this
        application for credit for the purpose of evaluating my credit and verifying my
        identity, or for updating, renewing, servicing, modifying or collecting any credit
        that I may obtain. Upon request, you will inform me whether or not a
        consumer report was requested. If a report was requested, you will inform me
        of the name and address of the consumer reporting agency that furnished the
        report. Any preliminary decision that the School makes about my eligibility for
        a retail installment contract does not mean the application process is final or
        guarantee the contract, or guarantee my approval for a contract later. My
        authorization to obtain consumer reports from consumer reporting agencies is
        valid as long as any amounts are owed on the contract. I certify that the
        information provided by me is true and complete to the best of my knowledge
        and belief. </p>
