        <h1>Confirm Credit Authorization</h1>
        <p>This is a final reminder that the TuitionFlex tuition credit plan requires a review of your (and your cosignerâ€™s,
        if applicable) credit bureau report for the purpose of determining your eligibility to obtain
        credit.</p>
        <p>
            By checking the box below, I authorize Education Loan Source, a National Lending Associates, Inc.
            company, on <School Name> or its designated agents, and any assignee or guarantor of this contract, to
                investigate my credit worthiness, to access, review and/or share with the School or its designated
                agents, or any assignee or guarantor of this retail installment contract, my credit report, and to furnish
                information about this application and my contract to consumer reporting agencies and other persons
                who may legally receive such information. A consumer report may be requested in connection with this
                application for credit for the purpose of evaluating my credit and verifying my identity, or for updating,
                renewing, servicing, modifying or collecting any credit that I may obtain. Upon request, you will inform
                me whether or not a consumer report was requested. If a report was requested, you will inform me of
                the name and address of the consumer reporting agency that furnished the report. Any preliminary
                decision that the School makes about my eligibility for a retail installment contract does not mean the
                application process is final or guarantee the contract, or guarantee my approval for a contract later. My
                authorization to obtain consumer reports from consumer reporting agencies is valid as long as any
                amounts are owed on the contract. I certify that the information provided by me is true and complete to
                the best of my knowledge and belief.
        </p>
